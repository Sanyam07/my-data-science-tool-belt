## The Zen of Python

Beautiful is better than ugly.\
Explicit is better than implicit.\
Simple is better than complex.\
Complex is better than complicated.\
Flat is better than nested.\
Sparse is better than dense.\
Readability counts.\
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\
Although practicality beats purity.\
Errors should never pass silently.\
Unless explicitly silenced.\
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\
There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.\
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\
Now is better than never.\
Although never is often better than *right* now.\
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

<!-- ## A Parable

The cheese-mites asked how the cheese got there,\
And warmly debated the matter;\
The Orthodox said that it came from the air,\
And the Heretics said from the platter.\
They argued it long and they argued it strong,\
And I hear they are arguing now;\
But of all the choice spirits who lived in the cheese,\
Not one of them thought of a cow.

BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE

Cast your eyes in the direction of the cow. üêÑ -->

show the variables in your environment     # %who_ls
```

## Mastering git

2 master rules:
- Never commit directly to master. Use feature branches;
- Always make sure git status is clean pull, checkout or merge.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to sweep or delete your branches when they've become unnecessary!
`git branch -d branchname`

### How to use features branches

```dash
git:(master)                               git status
# Make sure it is clean

git:(master)                               git checkout -b my-new-feature
git:(my-feature)                           git branch
```

We've created a new local branch called my-new-feature.
Therefore, any new commit will only apply to this branch.

### How to push a branch to GitHub

```dash
git:(my-feature)                           git add .
git:(my-feature)                           git commit -m 'clear and meaningful commit'
git:(my-feature)                           git push origin my-feature

git:(my-feature)                           git status
# Make sure this is clean

git:(my-feature)                           hub browse
# You can now create a pull request on GitHub

git:(my-feature)                           git checkout master
git:(master)                               git pull origin master
git:(master)                               git sweep

git:(master)                               git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### How to merge your branch to the master branch

```dash
git:(my-new-feature)                       git add .
git:(my-new-feature)                       git commit -m 'clear and meaningful commit'

git:(my-new-feature)                       git status
# Make sure this is clean

git:(my-new-feature)                       git checkout master
git:(master)                               git pull origin master

git:(master)                               git checkout my-new-feature
git:(my-new-feature)                       git merge master
```

### How to solve your conflicts

When you can't merge because of conflicts in an `unmergeable_branch`, follow this process:

```dash
git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git status
# Make sure this is clean

git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git checkout master

git:(master)                               git pull origin master

git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git checkout unmergeable_branch

git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git merge master

# Now you've fetched all conflicts locally, time to solve them üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
# Open your code editor and solve conflicts (locate them with cmd + shift + F)

# After that, you can commit your code
git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git add .
git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git commit -m "conflict solving"
git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git push origin unmergeable_branch

git:(unmergeable_branch)                   hub browse
# You can now create a pull request on GitHub

git:(unmergeable_branch)                   git checkout master
git:(master)                               git pull origin master
git:(master)                               git sweep

git:(master)                               git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### How to fix an accidental commit to master

When you committed some changes to `master` and wanted to commit them to a new branch, follow this process:

```dash
# First, create a new branch from the current state of master
git:(master)                               git checkout -b some-new-branch-name

# Remove the commit from the master branch
git:(some-new-branch-name)                 git checkout master
git:(master)                               git reset HEAD~ --hard

git:(some-new-branch-name)                 git checkout some-new-branch-name
# Your commit lives in this branch now
```
